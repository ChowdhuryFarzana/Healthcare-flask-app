# Health Care Persistency Prediction Web App

# Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application designed to predict patient persistence in healthcare using a Random Forest model. The app leverages exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy and provides a user-friendly interface for accessing machine learning insights.

# Features
Predictive Model: Uses a Random Forest algorithm to predict patient persistence based on provided data.
Data Analysis: Integrated exploratory data analysis to visualize trends and understand dataset characteristics.
Feature Engineering: Includes preprocessing techniques to prepare raw data for robust model performance.
Web Interface: Built with Flask, allowing users to input data and receive predictions in real-time.
## Tools & Libraries
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks: Flask
Libraries:
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Backend Utilities: Pandas
